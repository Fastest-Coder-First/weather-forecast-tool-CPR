# Python-Weather-Forecasting-Tool

This is a command-line tool that accepts a city's name and returns the weather forecast. It leverages the Open Weather Map API to fetch weather data and parse it using Python. The tool also demonstrates how GitHub Copilot can help with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.

# Usage

To use the tool, simply run the following command from the command line:


python filename.py <city_name>


For example, to get the weather forecast for London, you would run the following command:


python filename.py London


The tool will print out the weather forecast for the city you specified.
